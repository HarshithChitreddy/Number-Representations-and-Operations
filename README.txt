This project was developed as part of CS250: Foundations of Computer Systems at Colorado State University. The objective is to get familiar with number systems (binary, decimal, hexadecimal), perform bitwise operations, and manually implement conversions.

Features & Tasks :
Parse and identify number representations from command-line arguments (decimal, binary, hexadecimal).
Validate input numbers based on numbering system rules.
Convert numbers between different bases without using built-in Java conversion methods.
Compute 1’s complement and 2’s complement manually.
Perform bitwise OR, AND, XOR operations.
Implement left and right shifts manually for all numbers.
